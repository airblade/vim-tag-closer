INTRODUCTION                            *tag_closer*

There are quite a few tag-closing plugins already but they all close tags
eagerly, i.e. they generate the closing tag at the same time as the opening
tag.  I prefer to put in the closing tags when I get to where they should go.

Having said that, I don't want to actually type out each closing tag.  The
computer can do that for me.
